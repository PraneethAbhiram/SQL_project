# 📊 SQL Analytics & Data Engineering Practice Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a comprehensive **SQL Data Querying and Transformation repository** designed to demonstrate strong command over:

- Data exploration (DQL)  
- Data transformations  
- Analytical queries  
- Window functions  
- Real-world SQL problem solving  
- Data cleaning and deduplication logic  

The project simulates a **data warehouse environment** using customer, product, date, and transactional datasets.  
It reflects the type of SQL work performed in **Data Engineering and Analytics roles**, especially relevant for **Azure Data Engineer (ADE)** positions.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is organized across the following functional SQL areas:

├── Basic Queries (SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY)
├── Filtering & Pattern Matching (WHERE, LIKE)
├── Aggregations & Grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING)
├── Joins & Set Operations (INNER, LEFT, UNION)
├── Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
├── Numeric Transformations
├── Date & Time Functions
├── String Functions & Type Casting
├── Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)
├── Window Functions
├── Subqueries & CTEs
├── Real-world Scenarios
├── Views

## 🧱 Database Objects Used

### Dimension Tables
- dim_customer  
- dim_product  
- dim_date  

### Fact / Practice Tables
- orders  
- customers  
- weather  

These tables simulate **real enterprise datasets** such as customer masters, product catalogs, and time-series data.

## 🧠 Advanced SQL & Analytics

### ✅ Window Functions
- SUM() OVER()  
- AVG() OVER()  
- ROW_NUMBER()  
- RANK, DENSE_RANK  
- PARTITION BY  
- LAG, LEAD  
- Window frames  

### ✅ Subqueries & CTEs

## 👁️ Views

Views are created to demonstrate:

- Query abstraction  
- Reusability  
- Deduplication layers  

Example:
- dedupee_view – cleans duplicate customer records.
